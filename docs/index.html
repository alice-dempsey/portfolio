			<p class="text_box"> I'm a senior at Tufts University studying Computer Science and Religion. Originally from North Carolina, I'm now looking for a job in Boston after my graduation in May of 2021. <br> <br> I had a fantastic internship with Publicis Sapient this summer working on a Flutter interactive menu browsing app. Flutter is a native cross-platform development kit from Google, and I enjoyed working with it to build a mobile app for Android and iOS devices. I also learned a lot about how software engineers work in a professional environment by helping my team use Agile development to organize ourselves. <br> <br> I am currently applying to UX/UI and front-end development jobs, but I'm always looking for more opportunities to learn something new. <br> <br> Please check out my Portfolio page to see all the different types of projects I've worked on recently. And connect with me on LinkedIn! I'd love to chat :) <br> <br> <br> <br> Updated August 25, 2020</p>
